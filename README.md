# Polynomial-Regression-in-Javascript
A simple introduction of Polynomial Regression using Tensorflow.js

## What this Project is all about
I have tried to explain the concept of Polynomial Regression using Tensorflow.js also it helps to understand the basics of tensorflow.js

## How I have implemented Polynomial Regression.
I have predicted the square of a number. E.g. If you give a number to my algorithm it will predict its square. For this I have used first 100 digits as my training data.

## Why not Linear Regression 
Okay , mathematically if you ploat the graph of a number and its square you will get a parabola as shown below. Try it.
